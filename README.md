# Ransomware-by-Destiny
This simple code takes all files in system and encrypts them until user pay a certain amount of money
This encoding is done in base64.
Once this is installed on any system it remains dormant unless the system wastefully uses ram and run the program once run it encrypts all files except the application folder or if the user runs the code it does same too.
